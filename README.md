### Secure Sharing with RBAC
Link: [Secure-SharingRBAC](https://github.com/nannapat333/secure-sharing-RBAC)

Objective:A junior-year group project focused on building a secure file-sharing system that enforces role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption to protect sensitive documents.

Description:
This web application allows users to upload, share, view, and download encrypted files with strict access controls. Each file is encrypted using a randomly generated AES key, which is then securely distributed to authorized users using RSA encryption. User roles — Admin, Uploader, Viewer, and Guest — define what actions can be performed, with permissions strictly enforced across the platform. The system supports secure viewing of PDFs, images, and text files, with downloadable access where permitted.

Skills:
Full-Stack Web Development (Flask + Jinja2 + SQLAlchemy)
Cryptographic Implementation (AES + RSA)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Design
Secure File Handling
User Authentication & Authorization
UI Design and Frontend Integration

Technology:
Flask (Python Web Framework)
SQLAlchemy + SQLite
Flask-Login
PyCryptodome (AES/RSA Encryption)
HTML/CSS with Bootstrap

### Movies Recommendation System
Link: [Movies-Recommendation-System](https://github.com/nannapat333/movie-recommender-svd)

Objective: To build a personalized movie recommendation system that predicts user ratings and suggests top movies using the SVD algorithm, optimized for low RMSE.

Description:
This project implements a movie recommender system using the Surprise library’s SVD algorithm. It includes hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, RMSE evaluation on a validation set, and top-N movie recommendations for each user. The output is exported to a CSV file for further analysis or integration.
